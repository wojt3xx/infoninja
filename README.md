 A small tool for gathering some web information that I wrote as I side project using BS4. If you need to crawl the website for links and emails, feel free to use this tool.

## Prerequisites:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install bs4
```

## Usage:
Add the URL after file name that you need to crawl when running the script

You will find a textfile including emails and links in the same directory as the script
